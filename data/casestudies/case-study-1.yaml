        id="isPasted"><p>&ldquo;It was my chance to pause. I thought yes, [recruitment
        experts] know the industry and your brand is pretty well-known in the market,
        but you&rsquo;re still struggling, and that&rsquo;s because of all the other
        stuff you hadn&rsquo;t stopped to think about.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p data-block-key="r51lf"><br></p><h3
        data-block-key="975ho" id="isPasted">Business: more than a mission</h3><p
        data-block-key="ecloh">It can be easy to get carried away at the start of
        a new business, especially if you hit the ground running with clients from
        the start. But without a good strategy in place, you&rsquo;ll struggle to
        grow your business in a sustainable way. Yemi admits that in the early days,
        she didn&rsquo;t have a strategy, or even a business plan.</p><p data-block-key="9078p">&ldquo;A
        little knowledge is a dangerous thing because I was an ex-finance director
        and had worked in big corporations. My assumption was that it&rsquo;s just
        a small business so it&rsquo;ll be fine, but you don&rsquo;t know what you
        don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p data-block-key="2ldis">Meeting with her board
        from Be the Business has helped Yemi to stay on track with planning, as well
        as giving her access to different outlooks and ideas.</p><p data-block-key="86si9"><br></p><h3
        data-block-key="4qr1t">Developing your offering</h3><p data-block-key="f8pbl">Starting
        Engage Transform with a core mission helped the business to stand out and
        achieve some early successes. However, it can be easy to pigeonhole yourself
        and limit your scope to adapt, innovate and grow as a business.</p><p data-block-key="diqd4">&ldquo;When
        I first started the business I was 100% focused on recruitment and never thought
        about complementary services&hellip;I thought I could only offer one product
        and now I offer at least three products plus other consultancy services. It&rsquo;s
        really strengthened our core business.&rdquo;</p><p data-block-key="aasjh">Having
        access to a mix of marketing, IT and finance experts through Be the Business
        has given Yemi a range of sector expertise to draw on. As a passionate advocate
        of workplace diversity, Yemi knows how effective a mix of experience and backgrounds
        can be, and here it has meant she now offers services and products like coaching
        for candidates.</p><p data-block-key="7t7ou"><br></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;While
        recruitment is supporting clients to find candidates, if I can offer the candidates
        something that will help them to develop, that&rsquo;s fantastic. I don&rsquo;t
        know if I would have developed these other offers had it not been for the
        programme.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h3 data-block-key="r51lf">Outside your
        comfort zone</h3><p data-block-key="d4r4r">In addition to broadening the offer
        of the business, Yemi has also undertaken some personal development after
        being inspired by ideas from her board. She now considers thought leadership
        and owning the space around diverse workplaces and leadership an integral
        part of the business.</p><p data-block-key="blju7">Engage Transform also now
        offer speaking engagements and training with leaders and teams around inclusive
        recruitment, to support their core offer of finding or developing candidates.</p><p
        data-block-key="6d0r8">It&rsquo;s important to know what you want to get out
        of the process of meeting with an advisory board, Yemi stresses, as she admits
        she hasn&rsquo;t used it as much as she could have. She adds that it has been
        handy to have a place to go to sound out ideas and challenges, and receive
        helpful tips and real-world examples from other business leaders.</p><p data-block-key="9mlva">&ldquo;It
        all depends on the quality of questions you ask and the problems you bring
        to the table. You get as much out of it as you put in.&rdquo;</p><p data-block-key="6elkv"><br></p><h3
        data-block-key="62f9t">Resilience through diversity</h3><p data-block-key="1v3g1">Having
        a more varied offer than when the business first started has helped Engage
        Transform to weather the economic downturn, when recruitment has stalled in
        some industries. Being able to pivot between working with larger companies
        and individuals has meant that the company has not been as affected by these
        challenges.</p><p data-block-key="20fu2">Yemi has also found that the Be the
        Business meetings have helped her to stay on top of budgets and forecasting,
        as it&rsquo;s something the group discuss and delve into. She says that she
        now knows the importance of having a clear idea of the numbers, not just having
        it in your head!</p>'
      takeaway:
      - headline: Think about the future today
        body: "<p>Don&#39;t only focus on the short term goals, think ahead about
          where you want to be - in order to plan for how to get there. Longer term
          thinking can help you plan ahead.</p>"
      - headline: Failures help you to learn
        body: "<p>Remember to regularly reflect and review on your successes and your
          mistakes, so you can grow for the future. Learning from things that went
          wrong will help you be more resilient for the future.</p>"
