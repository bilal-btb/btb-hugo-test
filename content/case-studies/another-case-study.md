      headline: I gained different perspectives from people who aren’t in my industry
      description: Victor Amadiegwu launched his video production company in 2016
        and has been steadily growing his business ever since. Always looking for
        new ways to grow and learn, he joined the Be the Business Boards programme
        to gain a new perspective on his business.
      body: <p>Victor Amadiegwu launched his video production company in 2016 and
        has been steadily growing his business ever since. Always looking for new
        ways to grow and learn, he joined the Be the Business Boards programme to
        gain a new perspective on his business.</p><blockquote id="isPasted"><p>&quot;The
        board members I ended up with allowed me to never stop learning. I could communicate
        with them easily through LinkedIn or email if I ever needed to reach out&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p
        data-block-key="9l3m9">After hearing about Be the Business from LinkedIn,
        Victor immediately knew that he wanted to get involved. He found that the
        format of the programme was unique compared to anything else out there, and
        so was a great opportunity to &ldquo;add to his arsenal&rdquo;.</p><h2 data-block-key="ffs19">The
        power of putting yourself out there</h2><p data-block-key="9hqg5">One of the
        main takeaways that Victor learned from his board was to put himself out there
        more. By giving a face to the business, his audience was able to connect with
        him more &ndash; which gave him an entirely new marketing approach.</p><p
        data-block-key="4o8qa">&ldquo;People buy from people. In the past, I&rsquo;ve
        been reluctant to put myself out there, but [my board] encouraged me to talk
        a bit more about me to give my business a different view. For example, I put
        out a post where I spoke about a specific service of mine, but it was a video
        I filmed of myself explaining the service,&rdquo; Victor said.</p><p data-block-key="e5ar">The
        result? Victor opened himself up to an array of exciting new opportunities
        &ndash; including working with us to create video content, where his first-hand
        experience of using our services proved incredibly useful.</p><p data-block-key="4n8le">&ldquo;I
        worked with Be the Business to produce content. They hired me for video production
        and I worked with them for four months. I got to see first-hand what businesses
        were looking for because it was myself and my team were filming the content,&rdquo;
        Victor stated.</p><h2 data-block-key="8ap4p">Learning to set realistic goals</h2><p
        data-block-key="26mt7">A common challenge for small business owners is&nbsp;<a
        href="https://www.bethebusiness.com/guides/an-introduction-to-balancing-ambition-with-setting-realistic-goals/">setting
        goals that are both ambitious and realistic</a>. While it&rsquo;s important
        to challenge yourself to reach your best potential, having unattainable goals
        is just setting yourself up for failure.</p><p data-block-key="30b3j">This
        is something that Victor struggled with, and through advice from his board,
        he was able to redefine his goals and stay on track with hitting them. Victor
        found that one of the best ways to do this was to focus on what he was passionate
        about.</p><p data-block-key="25ira">&ldquo;One of my goals is to find a way
        to help young people from disengaged environments into better paths through
        creativity, video production and content creation. I&rsquo;m quite passionate
        about that, and I want to build an extension of my business to address it,&rdquo;
        Victor confirms.</p><p data-block-key="8kv8p">&ldquo;To define those goals
        we went through how I can get there, who I need to speak to and how I need
        to keep on top of it. We also looked at how the goals may need to adapt to
        the changes within my industry.&rdquo;</p><h2 data-block-key="ca61g">Never
        stop learning, never stop growing</h2><p data-block-key="3jgmc">Having completed
        the programme, Victor is able to reflect on the advice he&rsquo;s received
        and how he can implement it in the future. He now recognises that, for his
        business to continue to grow, he needs to pivot his role in the business so
        he&rsquo;s more focused on strategy and business development, rather than
        being &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo;.</p><p data-block-key="dp4r">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s
        made me look at my own leadership and the importance of looking at aspects
        of the business that could help us grow, as opposed to doing things that we&rsquo;ve
        always just done before.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;My aspiration for
        the next year is to work in a way where I&rsquo;m more hands-off with my business,
        but still have a team where the vision and ethos is similar to mine&quot;</p></blockquote><p
        data-block-key="9xb8j">As to whether or not people should engage with Be the
        Business, Victor says &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo;, asserting that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
        always a good idea to have people that have been through a journey to give
        you pointers on the journey you&rsquo;re going through&rdquo;.</p>

            id="isPasted"><p>&ldquo;It was my chance to pause. I thought yes, [recruitment
            experts] know the industry and your brand is pretty well-known in the
            market, but you&rsquo;re still struggling, and that&rsquo;s because of
            all the other stuff you hadn&rsquo;t stopped to think about.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p
            data-block-key="r51lf"><br></p><h3 data-block-key="975ho" id="isPasted">Business:
            more than a mission</h3><p data-block-key="ecloh">It can be easy to get
            carried away at the start of a new business, especially if you hit the
            ground running with clients from the start. But without a good strategy
            in place, you&rsquo;ll struggle to grow your business in a sustainable
            way. Yemi admits that in the early days, she didn&rsquo;t have a strategy,
            or even a business plan.</p><p data-block-key="9078p">&ldquo;A little
            knowledge is a dangerous thing because I was an ex-finance director and
            had worked in big corporations. My assumption was that it&rsquo;s just
            a small business so it&rsquo;ll be fine, but you don&rsquo;t know what
            you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p data-block-key="2ldis">Meeting with
            her board from Be the Business has helped Yemi to stay on track with planning,
            as well as giving her access to different outlooks and ideas.</p><p data-block-key="86si9"><br></p><h3
            data-block-key="4qr1t">Developing your offering</h3><p data-block-key="f8pbl">Starting
            Engage Transform with a core mission helped the business to stand out
            and achieve some early successes. However, it can be easy to pigeonhole
            yourself and limit your scope to adapt, innovate and grow as a business.</p><p
            data-block-key="diqd4">&ldquo;When I first started the business I was
            100% focused on recruitment and never thought about complementary services&hellip;I
            thought I could only offer one product and now I offer at least three
            products plus other consultancy services. It&rsquo;s really strengthened
            our core business.&rdquo;</p><p data-block-key="aasjh">Having access to
            a mix of marketing, IT and finance experts through Be the Business has
            given Yemi a range of sector expertise to draw on. As a passionate advocate
            of workplace diversity, Yemi knows how effective a mix of experience and
            backgrounds can be, and here it has meant she now offers services and
            products like coaching for candidates.</p><p data-block-key="7t7ou"><br></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;While
            recruitment is supporting clients to find candidates, if I can offer the
            candidates something that will help them to develop, that&rsquo;s fantastic.
            I don&rsquo;t know if I would have developed these other offers had it
            not been for the programme.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h3 data-block-key="r51lf">Outside
            your comfort zone</h3><p data-block-key="d4r4r">In addition to broadening
            the offer of the business, Yemi has also undertaken some personal development
            after being inspired by ideas from her board. She now considers thought
            leadership and owning the space around diverse workplaces and leadership
            an integral part of the business.</p><p data-block-key="blju7">Engage
            Transform also now offer speaking engagements and training with leaders
            and teams around inclusive recruitment, to support their core offer of
            finding or developing candidates.</p><p data-block-key="6d0r8">It&rsquo;s
            important to know what you want to get out of the process of meeting with
            an advisory board, Yemi stresses, as she admits she hasn&rsquo;t used
            it as much as she could have. She adds that it has been handy to have
            a place to go to sound out ideas and challenges, and receive helpful tips
            and real-world examples from other business leaders.</p><p data-block-key="9mlva">&ldquo;It
            all depends on the quality of questions you ask and the problems you bring
            to the table. You get as much out of it as you put in.&rdquo;</p><p data-block-key="6elkv"><br></p><h3
            data-block-key="62f9t">Resilience through diversity</h3><p data-block-key="1v3g1">Having
            a more varied offer than when the business first started has helped Engage
            Transform to weather the economic downturn, when recruitment has stalled
            in some industries. Being able to pivot between working with larger companies
            and individuals has meant that the company has not been as affected by
            these challenges.</p><p data-block-key="20fu2">Yemi has also found that
            the Be the Business meetings have helped her to stay on top of budgets
            and forecasting, as it&rsquo;s something the group discuss and delve into.
            She says that she now knows the importance of having a clear idea of the
            numbers, not just having it in your head!</p>'
